# Spotify CLone

## Alive site: https://spot-clone-xi.vercel.app/

### This project is not yet finished and I continue to work on it.

This is React-Spotify app, a React front end client that communicates with the Spotify API.

The public API provided by Spotify for Developers was used to create this project. 
To start working with the API and the site, you need to go through the authorization process.

__Authorization goes through the Spotify system itself, so you don't have to worry about the security of your data. Spotify implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework__

The goal of this project was to create a clone of the famous music platform Spotify. Which will display new releases, popular playlists, song pages with their lyrics, etc.

### In this project, i used:

- ReactJS and TypeScript
- Using React Bootstrap, React Router, React Icons, React Spinners, Cdbreact
- Fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI.
- The authorization process through the Spotify system

Setup: run npm i && npm start - to start the development server
